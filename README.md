## cograd : Conjugate Gradient Algorithms in Python

### About:

cograd contains exposed algorithms for Non-Linear Conjugate Gradient descent that allows for
 more control over the optimization process. It is specifically designed
for use when evaluation of the underlying function is very slow, computationally expensive
and complex (e.g. a numerical simulation). It also contains a novel implementation of
the line search algorithm that utilizes Gaussian Processes to help it work better under these conditions.
